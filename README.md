# vagrant-chef-composer

A shortcut to a dev environment with PHP Composer on Vagrant (1.2+) provisioned by Chef.

Composer is a package management system for PHP. You can get more information about it at [getcomposer.org](http://getcomposer.org).

The short form is this:

* Change to the project directory.
* Edit composer.json
* Run ```composer install```.

This particular installation comes with the Slim Framework listed in the composer.json. Slim is a PHP microframework inspired by projects like Sinatra and Flask.
